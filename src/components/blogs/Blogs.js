            Authentication verifies who the user is.Authentication works through
            passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other
            information provided or entered by the user.Authentication is the
            first step of a good identity and access management
            processAuthentication is visible to and partially changeable by the
            user.

            <legend>Authorization</legend>
            Authorization determines what resources a user can
            access.Authorization works through settings that are implemented and
            maintained by the organization.Authorization always takes place
            after authentication.Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by
            the user.
